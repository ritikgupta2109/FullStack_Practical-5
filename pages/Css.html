It also helps save a lot of work because controlling the layout of multiple web pages can be done all at a time.
         It helps in representing how markup-based documents can be presented in conjunction with HTML. The latest version of CSS was released in CSS3.
         
CSS is said to as the cornerstone design tool of the World Wide Web along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS is intended for enabling the separation of appearance with content, which includes layout, coloring, and font styles. 
Such a smart approach can progress the accessibility of content, offer more flexibility, and organize in the presentation order. It allows multiple web pages to contribute to formatting by giving relevant CSS instructions in another file with the file extension .css. This separation of design implementation helps in reducing complexity as well as repetition in the structural content.
